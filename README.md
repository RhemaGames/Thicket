# Thicket
Media Delivery Platform based on IPFS,OpenSeed,and HIVE

Written completely in Godot, Thicket is a one stop shop for Games,and Music. Thicket's goal is to create a complete solution for indie game devs and independant musicians. Thicket uses OpenSeed which is currently being developed in concert with Thicket and various other social platforms in order to create Open Source network for communications, online storage, and digital asset ownership. Check out OpenSeed's github repo [here](https://github.com/OpenSeedINC/OpenSeed/)

# Current version 

During development Thicket will stay in lockstep with the lastest beta version of Godot (3.2 beta 5 at time of writing). Once the project becomes stable and has all the features laid out in the MVP we will branch out and have a stable and development branch. Until that time breakage may happen. 

# Getting involved. 

As the project is under heavy development and not yet ready for community code involvement but feel free to create issues or join the conversation in discord,

# Game Developers

One of OpenSeed's core functions is to give Steamcloud like services for games (chat,save file syncing,leaderboards,etc.) that is cross platform (even cross game!). If you are currently working on a game using Godot feel free to drop in to the discord so we can fine tune the experience for you!
